<!-- Full-stack Software Engineer & Data scientist. -->

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Oyelowo, a Fullstack Software Engineer and the creator of [Surreal-ORM](https://github.com/Oyelowo/surreal-orm), a pioneering Object-Relational Mapping and query-building library for Rust. 

ðŸ”­ I have a passion for developing and designing solidly tested software solutions and have extensive experience with a variety of technologies and tools, including Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, R, PostgresQL, MongoDB, Kubernetes, and AWS.

ðŸŒ± I'm a lifelong learner, always curious about new technologies, system behaviors, and customer use cases. 

<!-- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oyelowo) or check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codebreatherHQ/streams) for educational content. -->

ðŸ’¼ Currently, I am focused on empowering developers to manage data with a fresh perspective in Rust through my book "Mastering Graph Databases with Surreal-ORM in Rust".
